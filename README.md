# Classifying images of Salmon using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architechture
Salmon is a very popular fish known for its great nutritional qualities. In nature, Salmon have to do a lot of very intense swimming to survive and are known to be swimming against the stream. This type of behavior builds a lot of high quality meat filled with Omega-3 fatty acids (aka fish oil) and other key nutrients that can be consumed by humans. However, due to the large demand for salmon, farming salmon has become a very popular indusry to fill this demand. Farmed salmon live in a very different habitat than wild salmon mostly differing in diet and activity. Farmed salmon cannot swim as much as wild salmon do and therefore they don't develop the same type of muscle tissue. When raw salmon is eaten it contains a much larger quantity of nutrients than farmed salmon. Farmed salmon can be distinguished from raw salmon due to the difference in color. Raw salmon has the unique red color while farmed salmon looks pink. In the US, it is common practice to feed farmed salmon red dye in their feed to try to achieve the same red color in their meat so that the consumer feels comfortable with consuming it.
