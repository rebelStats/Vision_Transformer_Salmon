## Farmed vs Wild Salmon
Salmon is a very popular fish known for its great nutritional qualities. In nature, Salmon have to do a lot of very intense swimming to survive and are known to be swimming against the stream. This type of behavior builds a lot of high quality meat filled with Omega-3 fatty acids (aka fish oil) and other key nutrients that can be consumed by humans. However, due to the large demand for salmon, farming salmon has become a very popular method to produce more salmon for US consumers. Farmed salmon live in a very different habitat than wild salmon mostly differing in diet and activity. Farmed salmon cannot swim as much as wild salmon do and therefore they don't develop the same type of muscle tissue. When raw salmon is eaten it contains a much larger quantity of nutrients than farmed salmon. Farmed salmon can be distinguished from wild salmon due to the difference in color. Raw salmon has the unique red color that people have come to associated with the fish while farmed salmon looks more pink. In the US, it is common practice to feed farmed salmon red dye in their feed to try to achieve the same red color in their meat so that the consumer feels comfortable with consuming it. It would be useful for US consumers to know whether they are buying farmed or raw salmon so they are aware of the nutritional properties of the fish they are consuming. The purpose of this project is to use state-of-the-art algorithms and deploy a model that can distinguish wild salmon from farmed salmon.
